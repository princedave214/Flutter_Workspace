Flutter Assignments
Module 1: Introduction to Mobile Development and Flutter
THEORY ASSIGNMENTS
1. Benefits of Using Flutter Over Other Cross-Platform Frameworks

Flutter is a popular cross-platform framework developed by Google. It offers several advantages over other frameworks like React Native, Xamarin, and Ionic.

Benefits:

Single Codebase: One codebase for Android, iOS, web, and desktop.

High Performance: Uses Dart and compiles to native ARM code.

Hot Reload: Changes reflect instantly without restarting the app.

Rich UI: Provides beautiful, customizable widgets.

Open Source: Free and supported by a large community.

Consistent UI: Same look and behavior across platforms.

2. Role of Dart in Flutter & Its Advantages

Dart is the programming language used to build Flutter applications.

Role of Dart in Flutter:

Controls app logic, UI layout, and animations.

Compiles directly to native machine code.

Works efficiently with Flutter’s widget system.

Advantages of Dart:

Easy to learn (similar to C++, Java)

Fast execution and performance

Supports Hot Reload

Strong typing reduces runtime errors

Optimized for UI development

3. Steps to Set Up Flutter Development Environment

Step-by-Step Setup:

Download Flutter SDK from flutter.dev

Extract SDK and add Flutter to system PATH

Install Android Studio

Install Flutter & Dart plugins in Android Studio

Set up Android Emulator or connect a physical device

Verify installation using:

flutter doctor

4. Basic Flutter App Structure

A Flutter app follows a widget-based architecture.

Key Components:

main.dart: Entry point of the app

main() function: Starts the app using runApp()

Widget Tree: UI built using nested widgets

Example Structure:

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}


MyApp is a widget

Widgets form a tree (MaterialApp → Scaffold → Text)

PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENTS
1. Verify Flutter Installation Using flutter doctor

Open terminal or command prompt and run:

flutter doctor

This command checks:

Flutter SDK

Android SDK

Emulator setup

Dart installation

2. Create a Flutter Project with Personalized “Hello World”

Create Project:

flutter create hello_flutter
cd hello_flutter
flutter run


Edit lib/main.dart:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Assignment'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Hello, Prince!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

3. Customize Background Color and Text Styles

Updated Code with Styling:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      home: Scaffold(
        backgroundColor: Colors.lightBlueAccent,
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Flutter Welcome App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text(
            'Welcome, Prince!',
            style: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 30,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              color: Colors.white,
              fontStyle: FontStyle.italic,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}


Customization Used:
Background color
Font size
Font color
Font style
