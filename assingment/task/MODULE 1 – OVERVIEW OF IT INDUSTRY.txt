MODULE 1 – OVERVIEW OF IT INDUSTRY
1. What is a Program?
LAB: Hello World in Flutter (Dart)

Flutter App (main.dart)

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}


Comparison

Dart uses main() as entry point

Flutter uses widgets instead of print statements

UI is built using widget tree

THEORY: What is a Program?

In Flutter, a program is a Dart file that contains instructions to build UI and handle user interaction.
It tells the device how to display screens and respond to events.

2. What is Programming?
THEORY: Programming Steps (Flutter Context)

Problem understanding (App idea)

UI design (Widgets)

Business logic (Dart code)

Testing (Hot reload, debug)

Deployment (APK / IPA)

3. Types of Programming Languages
THEORY

Dart is a high-level language

Flutter apps are compiled to native machine code

4. World Wide Web & Internet
LAB: Client–Server Flow (Flutter App)
Flutter App (Client)
      HTTP Request
Internet
     
Backend Server (API)
      JSON Response

THEORY: Client & Server

Flutter App → Client

API / Backend → Server

5. Network Layers on Client & Server
LAB: HTTP Request in Flutter
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchData() async 
{
  final response =
      await http.get(Uri.parse('https://example.com'));

  print(response.body);
}

THEORY: TCP/IP Layers

Flutter uses:

Application Layer - HTTP

Transport - TCP

Internet - IP

Network - Wi-Fi / Mobile Data

6. Client and Server
THEORY

Flutter apps send requests using HTTP packages and receive JSON data from servers.

7. Types of Internet Connections
LAB: Research (Flutter App Usage)

Broadband - Normal apps

Fiber - Streaming & gaming apps

Satellite - Remote location apps

THEORY: Broadband vs Fiber

Flutter apps load faster on fiber due to low latency.

8. Protocols
LAB: HTTP Simulation in Flutter
http.get(Uri.parse('http://api.example.com'));

THEORY: HTTP vs HTTPS

Flutter prefers HTTPS for secure API calls.

9. Application Security
LAB: Security Issues in Flutter

Hardcoded API keys - Use env files

Insecure HTTP - Use HTTPS

Weak authentication - Use Firebase Auth

THEORY: Encryption

Flutter uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data.

10. Software Applications & Types
LAB: Flutter App Classification
App	Type
Android OS	type - System
Flutter App	type - Application

Flutter apps are application software.

11. Software Architecture
LAB: Flutter 3-Tier Architecture
UI (Widgets)
Logic (Provider / Bloc)
Data (API / Database)

Modularity helps Flutter apps scale easily.

12. Layers in Software Architecture
LAB: Example (E-commerce App)

UI - Product screen

Logic - Cart management

Data - API & database

Layers keep Flutter code clean and testable.

13. Software Environments
LAB: Flutter Environments

Development - Debug mode

Testing - Emulator

Production - Release APK

Development environment speeds up coding via hot reload.

14. Source Code
LAB: Flutter Source Code on GitHub

Upload lib/main.dart

Commit changes

Source code = Dart files
Machine code = Native binaries

15. GitHub Introduction
LAB: Flutter Git Commands
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Flutter app"
git push

Version control tracks Flutter app changes.

16. GitHub Student Account

Students get free private repos and CI tools for Flutter apps.

17. Types of Software
LAB
Software	Category
Flutter SDK	Utility
VS Code	        Application

Flutter is open-source.

18. GIT & GITHUB Training

Git enables team-based Flutter development.

19. Application Software
LAB

Flutter apps improve productivity (banking, delivery, learning).

Businesses use Flutter for cross-platform apps.

20. Software Development Process
LAB: Flutter SDLC
Idea → UI Design → Flutter Coding → Testing → Play Store → Updates

Same SDLC applies to Flutter apps.

21. Software Requirement
LAB: Library App (Flutter)

Login

Book list

Issue/return

Clear requirements prevent UI rework.

22. Software Analysis
LAB: Shopping App

User journey

Payment flow

Analysis defines Flutter screen behavior.

23. System Design
LAB: Food Delivery App

User app

Delivery tracking

Admin panel

Design decides app architecture.

24. Software Testing
LAB: Flutter Test Case
expect(2 + 2, 4);

Testing ensures bug-free apps.

25. Maintenance
LAB

Flutter apps require updates for bug fixes and OS changes.

Maintenance keeps apps usable.

26. Web vs Desktop Applications

Flutter supports:

Web apps

Desktop apps

Mobile apps

27. Web Application

Flutter Web:

No installation

Runs in browser

28. Designing (UI/UX)
THEORY

Flutter widgets help create smooth UI/UX.

29. Mobile Applications

Flutter is hybrid (cross-platform) but performs like native.

30. DFD
LAB: Hospital App
Patient - Flutter App - Server - Doctor


DFD helps plan Flutter data flow.

31. Desktop Application
LAB

Flutter supports Windows, macOS, Linux apps.

Desktop apps are faster but platform-dependent.

32. Flowchart
LAB: Registration Flow
Start - Input - Validate - Save - End

Flowcharts simplify Flutter logic planning.
