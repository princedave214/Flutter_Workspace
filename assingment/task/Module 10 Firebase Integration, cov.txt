Module 10: Firebase Integration, covering both theory and practical assignments for Flutter:

Theory Assignments
1. Purpose of Firebase and its Core Services

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform by Google that allows developers to build and scale apps quickly without managing servers. It provides real-time databases, authentication, analytics, and more.

Core Firebase Services:

Authentication: Sign-in and identity management (email/password, Google, Facebook, etc.)

Cloud Firestore: NoSQL cloud database for storing and syncing data in real-time.

Realtime Database: Older real-time database alternative to Firestore.

Cloud Storage: Store and serve files like images, videos, and documents.

Cloud Functions: Serverless backend logic (functions triggered by events).

Firebase Analytics: Track app usage and user behavior.

Firebase Messaging: Push notifications (FCM).

Firebase Crashlytics: Real-time crash reporting.

2. Firebase Authentication in Flutter

Firebase Authentication provides secure and easy ways to manage user sign-ups, logins, and identity verification.

Use Cases in Flutter Apps:

Email/password sign-up and login.

Social sign-in (Google, Facebook, Apple).

Anonymous sign-in for temporary accounts.

Managing user sessions in mobile apps.

Key Flutter Packages:

firebase_auth – for authentication.

google_sign_in – for Google login.

flutter_facebook_auth – for Facebook login.

3. Firestore vs Traditional SQL Databases

Firestore is a NoSQL document database, while SQL databases are relational.

Feature	Firestore	SQL Database
Data Structure	Document (JSON-like) in Collections	Tables and Rows
Schema	Flexible, dynamic	Fixed schema
Scalability	Horizontal scaling, cloud-native	Vertical scaling mainly
Queries	Collection-based, limited joins	Complex queries with joins
Real-time Updates	Built-in real-time listeners	Requires polling or triggers
Offline Support	Yes, local caching	Depends on implementation

Firestore is ideal for apps requiring real-time updates, offline access, and flexible data structures, like chat apps or social feeds.

Practical Assignments
1. Sign-up and Login with Firebase Authentication

Steps in Flutter:

Add Firebase to your Flutter project.

Add firebase_auth dependency.

Initialize Firebase in main.dart.

Create sign-up and login screens with TextFormField for email and password.

Use FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword for sign-up.

Use FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword for login.

Optionally, use StreamBuilder to track user login state.

2. Chat Application Using Firestore

Steps in Flutter:

Add cloud_firestore dependency.

Set up Firestore collections, e.g., chats → documents containing message, senderId, timestamp.

Create a chat UI with ListView to display messages.

Send messages using Firestore.instance.collection('chats').add({...}).

Use StreamBuilder to listen to real-time updates.

3. Image Gallery App with Firebase Storage

Steps in Flutter:

Add firebase_storage and image_picker dependencies.

Allow users to pick images from device gallery.

Upload images to Firebase Storage using FirebaseStorage.instance.ref('path').putFile(file).

Store image URLs in Firestore for easy retrieval.

Display images using Image.network(url) in a GridView.
