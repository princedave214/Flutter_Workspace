1. Waterfall Model

Definition:
A linear sequential model where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

Phases:
Requirement Analysis
System Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance

Diagram:
Requirement → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
Features:
Simple and easy to use.
Phases do not overlap.
Best for small, clear projects.

Benefits:
Easy to manage due to rigidity.
Works well when requirements are fixed.
Example:
Developing a calculator app with fixed features.

2. Agile Model

Definition:
An iterative and incremental model focusing on flexibility and customer collaboration.

Phases (Repeated in each iteration):
Plan
Design
Develop
Test
Release
Feedback
Diagram:
Cycle: Planning → Design → Develop → Test → Review → Repeat
Features:
Adaptive to change.
Fast delivery in small parts.
Focuses on working software.
Benefits:
Better product quality.
Customer satisfaction through frequent updates.
Example:
Creating an e-commerce app with regular feature updates.

3. Scrum Model (A type of Agile)

Definition:
A framework under Agile using sprints to deliver product increments.

Scrum Roles:
Product Owner – Defines product features.
Scrum Master – Facilitates the process.
Development Team – Builds the product.
Phases:
Product Backlog → Sprint Planning → Sprint (2–4 weeks) → Daily Standups → Sprint Review → Retrospective
Diagram:
Product Backlog → Sprint Planning → Sprint → Review → Retrospective → Repeat
Features:
Delivers working product in sprints.
Team collaboration and feedback.
Benefits:
High visibility and adaptability.
Improved product quality with each sprint.
Example:
Developing a chat app with new features added every 2 weeks.

4. Extreme Programming (XP)

Definition:
An Agile model focused on technical excellence and frequent releases.

Core Practices:
Pair programming
Continuous integration
Test-driven development (TDD)
Small releases
Diagram:
Plan → Design → Code (in pairs) → Test (frequently) → Release → Feedback
Features:
Emphasizes code quality.
Strong team communication.
Benefits:
Rapid delivery.
High code reliability.
Example:
Building a fintech application where code must be error-free and secure.

5. Spiral Model

Definition:
A risk-driven model combining iterative development and systematic aspects of waterfall.

Phases (in each spiral loop):
Identify Objectives
Identify and Resolve Risks
Development and Testing
Plan Next Iteration
Diagram:
A spiral with loops: Planning → Risk Analysis → Engineering → Evaluation → Repeat
Features:
Emphasizes risk analysis.
Suitable for large, complex projects.
Benefits:
Risk handling at each stage.
Flexibility to change.
Example:
Military or aerospace software projects with high-risk factors.

6. RAD (Rapid Application Development)

Definition:
A model that emphasizes rapid prototyping and fast feedback over long planning.

Phases:
Requirements Planning
User Design
Construction
Cutover
Diagram:
Requirements → User Design (Prototype) → Construction → Implementation
Features:
Quick delivery.
Uses reusable components.
Benefits:
Time-saving.
Encourages user involvement.
Example:
Developing a simple business inventory system in weeks.

7. Prototype Model

Definition:
A model where a working prototype is built to understand requirements.

Phases:
Requirements gathering
Quick Design
Build Prototype
User Evaluation
Refinement
Final Product
Diagram:
User Requirements → Quick Design → Prototype → Evaluation → Refinement → Final Product
Features:
Early visibility to the customer.
Helps clarify unclear requirements.
Benefits:
Reduces risk of failure.
Better understanding of user needs.
Example:
Developing a new user interface for a mobile app.
