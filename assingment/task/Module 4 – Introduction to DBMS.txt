Module 4 – Introduction to DBMS

1. Introduction to SQL

Theory Answers

1. What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to create, manage, and manipulate data in relational databases. It is essential because it allows users to store, retrieve, update, and control data efficiently.

2. Difference between DBMS and RDBMS
DBMS stores data as files, while RDBMS stores data in tables with relationships. RDBMS supports constraints, normalization, and SQL.

3. Role of SQL in relational databases
SQL is used to define structure (DDL), manipulate data (DML), retrieve data (DQL), control access (DCL), and manage transactions (TCL).

4. Key features of SQL

- Easy to learn
- Standardized language
- Supports data security
- Handles large datasets
- Supports transactions

Lab Exercises

sql
CREATE DATABASE school_db;
USE school_db;

CREATE TABLE students (
  student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  student_name VARCHAR(50),
  age INT,
  class VARCHAR(10),
  address VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO students VALUES
(1,'Amit',11,'6A','Delhi'),
(2,'Riya',10,'5B','Mumbai'),
(3,'Karan',12,'7A','Pune'),
(4,'Sneha',11,'6B','Chennai'),
(5,'Rahul',13,'8A','Kolkata');

SELECT * FROM students;



 2. SQL Syntax

 Theory Answers

1. Components of SQL syntax
Keywords, clauses, expressions, operators, and statements.

2. SELECT structure

sql
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition;


3. Role of clauses
Clauses filter, sort, group, and limit data.

 Lab Exercises

sql
SELECT student_name, age FROM students;
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 10;

 3. SQL Constraints

 Theory Answers

1. Constraints
Rules applied to table columns. Types: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT.

2. Primary vs Foreign Key
Primary key uniquely identifies a record. Foreign key links tables.

3. NOT NULL & UNIQUE
NOT NULL prevents empty values, UNIQUE prevents duplicates.

 Lab Exercises

sql
CREATE TABLE teachers (
  teacher_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  teacher_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  subject VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE
);

ALTER TABLE students
ADD teacher_id INT,
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_teacher FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id)
REFERENCES teachers(teacher_id);




 4. DDL Commands

 Theory

DDL defines database structure using CREATE, ALTER, DROP.

 Lab

sql
CREATE DATABASE university_db;

CREATE TABLE courses (
  course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  course_name VARCHAR(50),
  course_credits INT
);

 5. ALTER Command

 Theory

Used to modify table structure.

 Lab

sql
ALTER TABLE courses ADD course_duration INT;
ALTER TABLE courses DROP course_credits;

 6. DROP Command

 Theory

Removes database objects permanently.

 Lab

sql
DROP TABLE teachers;
DROP TABLE students;




 7. DML Commands

 Theory

INSERT adds data, UPDATE modifies data, DELETE removes data.

 Lab

sql
INSERT INTO courses VALUES (1,'DBMS',6),(2,'OS',5),(3,'CN',4);
UPDATE courses SET course_duration=60 WHERE course_id=1;
DELETE FROM courses WHERE course_id=3;




 8. DQL

 Theory

SELECT retrieves data. WHERE filters, ORDER BY sorts.

 Lab

sql
SELECT * FROM courses;
SELECT * FROM courses ORDER BY course_duration DESC;
SELECT * FROM courses LIMIT 2;




 9. DCL

 Theory

GRANT gives permissions, REVOKE removes them.

 Lab

sql
GRANT SELECT ON courses TO user1;
REVOKE INSERT ON courses FROM user1;
GRANT INSERT ON courses TO user2;

 10. TCL

 Theory

COMMIT saves changes, ROLLBACK undoes changes.

 Lab

sql
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK;
SAVEPOINT sp1;
ROLLBACK TO sp1;

 11. SQL Joins

 Theory

Joins combine data from multiple tables.

 Lab

sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id=d.dept_id;

SELECT d.dept_name, e.name
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.dept_id=e.dept_id;

 12. GROUP BY

 Theory

Groups rows for aggregate functions.

 Lab

sql
SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY dept_id;
SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY dept_id;

 13. Stored Procedure

 Theory

Stored procedures are precompiled SQL blocks.

 Lab

sql
CREATE PROCEDURE getEmployees(IN dept INT)
BEGIN
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE dept_id=dept;
END;

 14. SQL Views

 Theory

Views are virtual tables.

 Lab

sql
CREATE VIEW emp_view AS
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name FROM employees e JOIN departments d;

 15. Triggers

 Theory

Triggers execute automatically on events.

 Lab

sql
CREATE TRIGGER emp_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW SET NEW.last_modified = NOW();

 16–23. PL/SQL, Cursors & Savepoints

PL/SQL extends SQL with variables, loops, conditions, and cursors.

sql
DECLARE total NUMBER;
BEGIN
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total FROM employees;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(total);
END;
